The User Management function is a critical component of any software system that allows for the administration and control of user accounts and their access to various features. It includes functionalities such as user registration, authentication (login and logout), role-based access 
control, and profile management. This feature allows users to securely create accounts, log in to access services, manage their personal information, and recover or reset passwords when necessary. It also enables administrators to assign roles and permissions, activate or deactivate 
accounts, and monitor user activity to ensure proper use of the system. The rationale behind implementing a user management function lies in the need for both security and personalized user experience. By controlling who has access to the system and what level of 
access they have, the system can prevent unauthorized use and safeguard sensitive data. Rolebased access helps define clear boundaries between different types of users, such as administrators and regular users, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the system. Additionally, by 
enabling users to manage their profiles and preferences, the system offers a more tailored and efficient experience. The ability to monitor user activity also contributes to auditing, troubleshooting, and accountability. A scalable and well-designed user management module ensures the system can grow along with its user base while maintaining reliability, flexibility, and 
security.
